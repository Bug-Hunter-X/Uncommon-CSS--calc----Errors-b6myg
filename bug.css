The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or styling issues.  Specifically, the calculation within `calc()` might involve incompatible units (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages without proper conversion), leading to parsing errors or rendering problems.  Another issue could be the misuse of operators or parentheses, causing incorrect order of operations and therefore wrong calculation results.
